Gruesome Island ANNOUNCEMENT: 
We are most likely going to be switching to *C++!*

It shouldn't be too hard, but it needs to be done. Java is just not cooperating,
and we all have more experience with C++ overall, so... yeah, more info to come later

Update: I've re-started this project tentatively using the Angular framework over at my Gruesome Island Angular repo. Check it out!
